# gesq
nesq's game of life

## How to use
Gesq has two states, paused and unpaused. You can switch between them by pressing `esc`.
When paused you can click in a cell to toggle if it is alive or dead, you can also press space to advance to the next state.
When the game is unpaused the simulation will play and you won't be able to interact with it.

## Build and run
You will need [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) to build this code.

```console
$ ./build.sh run
```

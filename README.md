## How to use
Gesq has two states, paused and unpaused. You can switch between them by pressing `esc`.
When paused you can `click` in a cell to toggle if it is alive or dead, you can also press `space` to advance to the next state.
When the game is unpaused the simulation will play and you won't be able to interact with it.

## Build and run
You will need [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) to build this code.

```console
$ ./build.sh run
```
